  <p>On computer, we can easily upload the video to giphy and get the GIF Link.</p>

  <p>On your phone, things could be more complicated and this page means to help you through.</p>


  <p>First, we want to convert the video in your phone library by uploading to giphy. Go to the Giphy website and upload the video from your device.</p>
